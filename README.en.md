## PROJECT DESCRIPTION

This challenge aims to develop a JavaScript program that allows the user to randomly select a "Mystery Friend" from a provided list of names. The main functionalities implemented are:

- **`Validation of names containing only letters üî§:`** Using regular expressions.
- **`Validation of spaces and blank inputs ‚úÖ:`** The program only allows valid names to be entered. Blank data cannot be submitted.
- **`Validation of duplicate names üîÅ:`** The same name cannot be entered more than once. This validation works even if the name is written in uppercase or with extra spaces at the beginning or end.
- **`Validation of number of names entered üî¢:`** The selection can only be executed when at least two names are provided.
- **`User experience improvements ‚å®Ô∏è:`** The user can enter the names by clicking the "Add" ("A√±adir") button or by pressing ENTER. Additionally, a "New Game" ("Nuevo Juego") button was created, allowing the user to play multiple times!
