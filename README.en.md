## ABOUT ORACLE ONE PROGRAM

This project is a proposed challenge for the 8th group of candidates in the "Oracle Next Education" program (Oracle ONE), an initiative led by Oracle and Alura Latam. In this program, the selected participants develop programming skills to enhance their professional careers.
For more information about the program, visit its [website (in Spanish)](https://www.oracle.com/pe/education/oracle-next-education/).

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION

This challenge aims to develop a JavaScript program that randomly assigns a "Mystery Friend" to each player entered. The main functionalities implemented are:

- **`Validation of names containing only letters üî§:`** Using regular expressions.
- **`Validation of spaces and blank inputs ‚úÖ:`** The program only allows valid names to be entered. Blank data cannot be submitted.
- **`Validation of duplicate names üîÅ:`** The same name cannot be entered more than once. This validation works even if the name is written in uppercase or with extra spaces at the beginning or end.
- **`Validation of number of names entered üî¢:`** The draw can only be executed when at least three names are provided.
- **`User experience improvements ‚å®Ô∏è:`** The user can enter the names by clicking the "Add" ("A√±adir") button or by pressing ENTER. Additionally, a "New Game" ("Nuevo Juego") button was created, allowing the user to play multiple times!
- **`Confidentiality üîê :`** The result can only be shown to each person once. This feature helps maintain confidentiality, ensuring that other participants cannot see a Mystery Friend different from their own!
- **`Responsiveness üì±:`** Optimized for better display on mobile phones and tablets.
